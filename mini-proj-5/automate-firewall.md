### Steps:

1. **Add the `http` Provider to Your Configuration**:
   You need to explicitly specify the `http` provider in your `providers.tf` file. This ensures that Terraform knows to download and use the correct provider.

2. **Run `terraform init`**:
   Once youâ€™ve added the `http` provider, running `terraform init` will download and initialize the required provider.

### Solution:

#### Step 1: Update Your `main.tf`

You need to add the `http` provider to your `main.tf` file. Here's how you can modify it:

```hcl
# HTTP provider for fetching public IP
provider "http" {
  # This can be left empty, as the HTTP provider does not need configuration
}
```

#### Step 2: Run `terraform init`

After updating the `main.tf` file, run the following command to download and initialize the `http` provider:

```bash
terraform init
```

This command will install the `http` provider from the Terraform registry.

If you want to keep the parts of your Terraform configuration separate, you can split it into multiple files based on the logical components of your infrastructure. Here's a recommended naming structure for separating the concerns:

### 1. **Data Source File** (`data-sources.tf`)
   - This file will hold the external data sources used to fetch dynamic information, such as the public IP address.
   
   Example (`data-sources.tf`):
   ```hcl
   # Fetch the public IP address
   data "http" "my_ip" {
     url = "https://ipinfo.io/ip"
   }
   ```

#### Update Your `main.tf`

In your **`main.tf`** (or wherever you're defining the firewall rule), update it as follows:

```hcl
# Configure SQL Server Firewall Rules (allow your local IP)
resource "azurerm_mssql_firewall_rule" "allow_local_ip" {
  name             = "allow-local-ip"
  server_id        = azurerm_mssql_server.sql_server.id
  start_ip_address = "${data.http.my_ip.response_body}"
  end_ip_address   = "${data.http.my_ip.response_body}"
}
```
### Plan and Apply

Now that you've updated the configuration, run the following commands:

1. **Plan**:
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

2. **Apply**:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

This should create the Azure SQL firewall rule successfully in an automated fashion.
