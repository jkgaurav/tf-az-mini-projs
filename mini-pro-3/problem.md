### Mini Project 3: Deploy an Azure Virtual Machine (VM) Inside a Virtual Network Using Terraform

#### **Problem Statement:**
In this project, you’ll learn how to provision an Azure Virtual Machine (VM) inside the Virtual Network (VNet) you created in the previous mini-project. You’ll configure the VM with an admin username and password, and associate it with a public IP address and network security group (NSG) to control access.

#### **Objective:**
- Create a public IP address.
- Create a Network Interface (NIC) associated with the VNet and Subnet.
- Create a Network Security Group (NSG) with an SSH rule to allow access to the VM.
- Deploy a Linux Virtual Machine (Ubuntu) within the VNet.
- Output the public IP address of the VM.

#### **Time-box:**
2-3 hours
