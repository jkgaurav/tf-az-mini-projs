### **FAQ: Azure Application Gateway Configuration in Terraform**

#### **Subnet Configuration**

**Q1: Why does the Azure Application Gateway require a dedicated subnet?**  
The Azure Application Gateway requires a **dedicated subnet** to isolate its network traffic from other resources. This ensures that the Application Gateway functions correctly by preventing interference from other Azure services that might reside in the same subnet. Each Application Gateway deployment must be assigned its own dedicated subnet to handle ingress traffic and perform routing efficiently.

**Q2: What happens if I do not assign a dedicated subnet to the Application Gateway?**  
If you do not assign a dedicated subnet to the Application Gateway, deployment will fail, and you may encounter errors. Even if the deployment succeeds, network issues such as IP address conflicts or traffic routing problems could occur due to resource overlap, affecting the overall functionality of the Application Gateway.

**Q3: Can I share the Application Gateway subnet with other Azure resources like Virtual Machines?**  
No, sharing the Application Gateway’s subnet with other Azure resources (e.g., Virtual Machines) is not recommended. The Application Gateway requires isolated IP space within its subnet to manage incoming web traffic and provide load balancing and routing features without interference from other resources.

**Q4: What other Azure services benefit from dedicated subnets like the Application Gateway?**  
Other Azure services that often require or benefit from dedicated subnets include **Azure Firewalls**, **Azure Bastion**, and **VPN Gateways**. Similar to the Application Gateway, these services handle sensitive network operations and benefit from subnet isolation to ensure optimal performance and security.
